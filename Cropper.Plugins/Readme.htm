    <h1>Cropper Plugins v1.3</h1>

    <p>
      This is the Cropper Plugins v1.3 release. These plugins are
      extensions to the <a href='http://cropper.codeplex.com'>Cropper
        utility</a>, that allow it to send screen shots to various places
      or online services.  Cropper itself, and all these plugins, are
      free to use. </p>

    <h2>The Plugins</h2>
    <p>The plugins included here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AnimatedGif - last updated c. 2007</li>
      <li>AviFormat - last update c. 2007</li>
      <li>CountdownPng - allows you to specify a countdown delay before
        capturing. This gives you time to set up the shot, as is necessary,
        for example, when the screen shot is a popup menu.</li>
      <li>SendToEmail - attaches the screen shot to a new message in  your default
        email client</li>
      <li>SendToFlickr - posts the screenshot on the Flickr web-based photo
        sharing service</li>
      <li>SendToImageShack - posts the screenshot on the free <a href='http://ImageShack.us'>ImageShack</a> web-based photo
        sharing service</li>
      <li>SendToImgur - posts the screenshot on the free <a href='http://Imgur.com'>Imgur</a> web-based photo
        sharing service</li>
      <li>SendToOneNote - attaches the screenshot to a note in Microsoft
        OneNote</li>
      <li>SendToPaintDotNet - opens the screenshot in Paint.NET for editing. (Requires
        installation of <a href='http://getpaint.net'>Paint.NET</a>, a free image
        editing program.</li>
      <li>SendToS3 - sends the screen shot to Amazon&#39;s hosted storage
        service, S3. </li>
      <li>SendToTFSWorkItem - posts the screen shot to a new workitem opened in
        Microsoft&#39;s TFS. This works only with TFS 2008. </li>
      <li>SendToTwitPic - posts the screenshot on the
        free <a href='http://twitpic.com'>TwitPic</a> twitter-oriented photo
        sharing service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>To use the plugins</h2>
    <p>Copy the appropriate DLLs to the cropper plugins directory,
      typically something like <strong>\Program
        Files\Fusion8Design\Cropper\Plugins</strong>. You can copy only
      the DLLs that you want to use.  You should be able to figure out
      which DLLs provide which function, pretty easily, by their names.
    </p>


    <h2>Changes since v1.2 of the Plugins release</h2>
    <ol>

      <li>The Send-to-TinyPic plugin has been removed.  TinyPic is an online
        image-sharing service, similar to ImageShack or Imgur, except that the
        terms and conditions for the TinyPic service prohibit using scripts or
        tools (or anything other than a web browser, I suppose) for uploading
        images to the service. To discourage the use of tools, TinyPic has
        changed their transaction flow repeatedly, and recently introduced a
        Captcha page, which means the old TinyPic
        plugin no longer works with the current transaction flow required by
        the TinyPic website.  While these are not outright barriers to
        updating the TinyPic plugin for Cropper to make it work again,
        they do represent obstacles, both legal and technical. For that
        reason, I&#39;ve dropped the TinyPic plugin.
      </li>
      <li>The Send-to-TwitPic plugin is new.  It uploads an image to TwitPic,
        and then posts the image on your twitter feed. Optionally you can
        provide a Tweet message.  </li>

      <li>The ImageShack plugin is new.</li>

      <li>The Imgur plugin has been updated to use the Imgur API.  The v1.2
        version of the plugin used HTML screen-scraping, and it broke when
        Imgur changed their transaction flow. This version should be more reliable.</li>

      <li>The ImageShack, Imgur and TwitPic plugins depend on the Microsoft.Http.dll
        assembly, which is shipped as part of the WCF REST Starter Kit beta
        2. The Microsoft.Http.dll assembly must be placed in the Plugins
        directory of Cropper in order to be able to use either of these
        plugins. </li>

      <li> The S3 plugin has been changed to store its settings in the
        cropper.config file, in the standard way, via the IConfigurablePlugin
        interface. </li>

      <li> The TFS plugin has been changed to store its settings in the
        cropper.config file, in the standard way, via the IConfigurablePlugin
        interface. </li>

      <li> The Email plugin now allows you to choose the image format to
        use. Choices include BMP, JPG, and PNG. Previously you could only use
        JPG.  Or was it PNG?  I can&#39;t remember. </li>

      <li>The source code for all plugins has been fixed up and tweaked. Some
        of the plugins depended on old, outdated interfaces.  I&#39;m
        surprised they even worked. Now they should all work correctly.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>CropperPlugins and Cropper are Separate</h2>
    <p>Cropper is a screen shot tool.  It is produced in the <a href='http://Cropper.codeplex.com'>Cropper</a>
      project hosted on <a href='http://codeplex.com'>Codeplex.com</a>.  The
      <a href='http://CropperPlugins.codeplex.com'>CropperPlugins</a>
      project is a separately-managed project, also hosted on
      Codeplex, and it produces these plugins.
    </p>

    <p>The versions and release schedules between these projects are
      totally independent. The contributors to these projects are
      different. They are distinct projects.</p>

    <p>If you have a problem with cropper, you need to go to the cropper
      project page for help or support.  If you have a problem with one of
      these plugins, go to the cropperplugins project for support.
