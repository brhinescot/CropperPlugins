    <h1>Cropper Plugins v1.3.10</h1>

    <p>
      This is the Cropper Plugins v1.3 release. These plugins are
      extensions to the <a href='http://cropper.codeplex.com'>Cropper
        utility</a>, that allow it to send screen shots to various places
      or online services.  Cropper itself, and all these plugins, are
      free to use. </p>

    <h2>The Plugins</h2>
    <p>The plugins included here:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>AnimatedGif - generate an animated GIF from your
        screen. Really helpful for blog posts, illustrations. </li>

      <li>AviFormat - last update c. 2007.  Not sure of the status of
      this.</li>

      <li>CountdownPng - allows you to specify a countdown delay before
        capturing. This gives you time to set up the shot, as is necessary,
        for example, when the screen shot is a popup menu.</li>

      <li>SendToEmail - attaches the screen shot to a new message in  your default
        email client</li>

      <li>SendToFlickr - posts the screenshot on the Flickr web-based photo
        sharing service</li>

      <li>SendToImageShack - posts the screenshot on the
        free <a href='http://ImageShack.us'>ImageShack</a> web-based
        photo sharing service</li>

      <li>SendToImgur - posts the screenshot on the
        free <a href='http://Imgur.com'>Imgur</a> web-based photo
        sharing service</li>

      <li>SendToOneNote - attaches the screenshot to a note in Microsoft
        OneNote</li>

      <li>SendToPaintDotNet - opens the screenshot in Paint.NET for
        editing. Effective use of this plugin requires that you first
        install <a href='http://getpaint.net'>Paint.NET</a>, a free
        image editing program. If you install the plugin, but not
        Paint.NET, then the output option for Paint.NET will be visible
        but not enabled. When using the Paint.NET plugin, there&#39;s an
        option to automatically upload the image to a photo-sharing
        service when you&#39;re finished editing. Which is nice. </li>

      <li>SendToS3 - sends the screen shot to Amazon&#39;s hosted storage
        service, S3. Allegedly. </li>

      <li>SendToTFSWorkItem - posts the screen shot to a new workitem opened in
        Microsoft&#39;s TFS. This works only with TFS 2008. </li>

      <li>SendToTwitPic - posts the screenshot on the
        free <a href='http://twitpic.com'>TwitPic</a> Twitter-oriented photo
        sharing service. </li>

      <li>SendToPicasa - posts the screenshot on
          Google&#39;s <a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/'>Picasa
          photo sharing service</a>. </li>

      <li>SendToFacebook - posts the screenshot with a caption to
      Facebook. (Yes, this means that everyone will see your screenshots
      and realize you are a nerd.)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Installing the plugins</h2>

    <p>To install plugins, you must first have installed Cropper.  After
      insuring that Cropper has been installed, copy the appropriate
      plugin DLLs and their dependencies to the Cropper <em>plugins</em>
      directory, typically something like <strong>\Program
      Files\Fusion8Design\Cropper\Plugins</strong>. You can copy only
      the DLLs that you want to use along with their dependencies (**see
      below). You should be able to figure out which DLLs provide which
      function, pretty easily, by their names.
    </p>

    <h3>Dependencies</h3>

    <p>All of the plugins in this package depend on the
      CropperPlugins.Common.dll assembly, which is included in the
      download.  CropperPlugins.Common is not a plugin itself; it merely
      provides some commonly-used logic to all plugins.  The
      CropperPlugins.Common.dll must be copied to the <em>plugins</em>
      directory  of Cropper, if you use any of the plugins in this
      package.
    </p>

    <p>The ImageShack, Imgur, and Picasa plugins all depend on the
      Microsoft.Http.dll assembly, which is shipped as part of
      the <a href='http://aspnet.codeplex.com/releases/view/24644'>WCF
        REST Starter Kit beta 2</a>, which is produced by Microsoft. You
      must copy the
      Microsoft.Http.dll and Microsoft.Http.Extensions.dll assemblies
      to the <em>plugins</em> directory of Cropper in order to
      be able to use any of these three plugins. </p>

    <p>The Send-to-Flickr plugin depends on the Flickrnet library, which is
      produced under the <a href='http://Flickrnet.codeplex.com'>Flickrnet
        project on Codeplex</a>.  You must copy the FlickrNet.dll assembly
      to the <em>plugins</em> directory of Cropper in order to use the Send-to-Flickr
      plugin.
   </p>


    <h3>Versioning</h3>

    <p>The plugins of a particular version of the CropperPlugins
      project, for example v1.3.10, are intended to all be used
      together. They share a common dependency,
      CropperPlugins.Common.dll, of the same version.  Therefore it is
      not possible to mix plugins from different versions of the
      CropperPlugins project.  If you use the Email plugin from v1.3.10,
      and you also wish to use the Flickr plugin, then you must use the
      Flickr plugin from v1.3.10.  You cannot use the Flickr plugin from
      CropperPlugins v1.3.9.
    </p>

    <p>When updating any plugins that you use from CropperPlugins, you should
      update <em>all</em> of the plugins you use.  You need not use all
      plugins, but any of them you choose to use, should be of the same
      version.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes since v1.2 of the Plugins release</h2>
    <ol>

      <li>The Send-to-Picasa plugin is new (in v1.3.2 of
        CropperPlugins).  It uploads an image to the Picasa photo
        sharing service. </li>

      <li>The Send-to-Facebook plugin is new (in v1.3.4 of
        CropperPlugins).  It uploads an image and caption to Facebook.
        </li>

      <li>The Send-to-TwitPic plugin is new (for v1.3.1).  It uploads an image to
        TwitPic, and then posts the image on
        your <a href='http://twitter.com'>Twitter feed</a>. Optionally
        you can provide a Tweet message.  New for v1.3.3, this plugin uses
        the OAuth protocol for authentication without a username + password.
      </li>

      <li>The Send-to-ImageShack plugin is new in v1.3.</li>

      <li>The Send-to-Imgur plugin has been updated to use the Imgur API.  The v1.2
        version of the plugin used HTML screen-scraping, and it broke when
        Imgur changed their transaction flow. The v1.3 plugin should be more reliable.</li>

      <li> The Send-to-S3 plugin has been changed to store its settings in the
        cropper.config file, in the standard way, via the IConfigurablePlugin
        interface. </li>

      <li> The Send-to-TFS-workitem plugin has been changed to store its settings in the
        cropper.config file, in the standard way, via the IConfigurablePlugin
        interface. </li>

      <li> The AnimatedGif plugin now supports configuration.  With one
        option, you can elect to automatically pop the generated GIF in
        the default viewer on your computer.  There are other options
        regarding generation of the animated GIF.  All of this is done
        in IConfigurablePlugin - which means the dialog is hosted in the
        tabbed UI presented by Cropper (core) under the "Options..."
        menu choice. New for v1.3.8, the plugin allows you to disable
        the beep sound that signals the begin and end of capture. New
        for v1.3.9, the plugin lets you configure a program to use to
        open the animated gif after it is captured. This can be an
        editor or a viewer. For an editor, I like the free Beneton Movie
        Gif. </li>

      <li> The Send-to-Email plugin now allows you to choose the image format to
        use. Choices include BMP, JPG, and PNG. Previously you could only use
        JPG.  Or was it PNG?  I can&#39;t remember. Anyway, it&#39;s fixed now. </li>

      <li> The Send-to-PaintDotNet plugin now works on x64.  Also new,
        it allows you to optionally upload the image to your choice of
        photo-sharing service<em>after editing it</em>.  In the options
        panel for Send-to-PaintDotNet, you can choose from ImageShack,
        Imgur, TwitPic, Flickr, Picasa, or Facebook. (The DLLs have to
        be installed in the plugins directory in order to be available
        as choices.)  The upload happens as soon as you close Paint.NET,
        or close the file within Paint.NET. This feature is new for
        v1.3.5. </li>

      <li>The Send-to-TinyPic plugin has been removed.  TinyPic is an online
        image-sharing service, similar to ImageShack or Imgur, except that the
        terms and conditions for the TinyPic service prohibit using scripts or
        tools (or anything other than a web browser, I suppose) for uploading
        images to the service. To discourage the use of tools, TinyPic has
        changed their transaction flow repeatedly, and recently introduced a
        Captcha page, which means the old TinyPic
        plugin no longer works with the current transaction flow required by
        the TinyPic website.  While these are not outright barriers to
        updating the TinyPic plugin for Cropper to make it work again,
        they do represent obstacles, both legal and technical. For that
        reason, I&#39;ve dropped the TinyPic plugin.
      </li>

      <li>The Send-to-Flickr plugin has been updated. It now uses the standard
        cropper.config settings file, via IConfigurablePlugin. The image
        format is selectable in the configuration menu.  Also,
        it&#39;s been updated to use the current version (v3.1) of the
        Flickrnet library.  </li>

      <li>The source code for all plugins has been fixed up and tweaked. Some
        of the plugins depended on old, outdated interfaces.  I&#39;m
        surprised they even worked. Now they should all work correctly.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>CropperPlugins and Cropper are Separate</h2>


    <p>Cropper is a screen shot tool.  It is produced in
      the <a href='http://Cropper.codeplex.com'>Cropper</a> project
      hosted on <a href='http://codeplex.com'>Codeplex.com</a>.  The
      designer of Cropper has made it possible for third-parties to
      construct "plugins" that enable Cropper to do different things
      with its screenshots. </p>

    <p>The <a href='http://CropperPlugins.codeplex.com'>CropperPlugins</a>
      project is a separately-managed project, also hosted on Codeplex,
      and it produces plugins for Cropper, as described here.
    </p>

    <p>The versions and release schedules between these projects are
      totally independent. The contributors to these projects are
      different people. They are distinct projects.</p>

    <p>If you have a problem or question related to Cropper, you need to
      go to the <A href='http://cropper.codeplex.com'>cropper project
      page</a> for help or support.  If you have a problem with one of
      these plugins, go to
      the <a href='http://cropperplugins.codeplex.com'>cropperplugins
      project</a> for support.
    </p>


    <h2>Confessions</h2>
    <ol>

    <li> I don&#39;t have an account for Amazon&#39;s S3; also I
    don&#39;t have a credit card, so I can&#39;t even get a free
    account.  Therefore I haven&#39;t tested the Send-to-S3 plugin,
    beyond basic configuration. </li>

    <li> I don&#39;t have a TFS 2010 server with which I can test the
    Send-to-TFS-Workitem plugin either.  </li>

    <li> I haven&#39;t tested the OneNote plugin, for similar reasons.
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>I&#39;m interested in getting test volunteers. If anyone wants to
    volunteer to test any of these, please let me know. Or, you could
    just test them and let me know what you find. </p>
