Readme for Cropper.Plugins/Imgur


This is a plugin for Cropper, it uploads to the free image-hosting
service at Imgur.com .

It works like the TinyPic plugin, or the Flickr plugin.

To use it, just drop the DLL into the plugins directory, and restart
cropper.

The plugin uses the Windows cache of HTTP Cookies for imgur.com, so I
think you may have had to visit imgur.com once in your browser before
using the plugin.  Not sure though.



Bugs
------------

I don't know why, but after one use, this plugin stops working for a
time. There's a timeout in the Imgur session, or something.  If you wait
long enough, it will work again.


License
------------

This plugin is licensed under the MS Public License. See the License.txt
file for details.
